# Work and solutions associated with my teaching assignments

In this repository you can find the codes and solutions associated with my various teaching assignments. 

## Econometrics 2 - Spring 2014

The master's course completes the econometrics sequence, focusing on: the theory of the asymptotic distribution of M-estimators; maximum-likelihood properties, derivation of estimators, and its asymptotic properties; the theory behind GMM estimation, its asymptotic properties, and robust estimation of the asymptotic variance for plausible inference testing; other forms of instrumented regressions (such as IV and the 2-stage least squares); and an introduction to time-series analysis that serves as a primer for the next course.

## GSE Tutoring - Econometrics

In this file one can find Jupyter Notebooks implemented with the Matlab kernel containing practice programming exercises and homework solutions for those students who I have tutored in the Macroeconmic Policy and Financial Markets Program at the Barcelona Graduate School of Economics. 

The following websites detail how get Matlab working in Jupyter Notebooks and in Python (if desired) on OSX/Linux/UBUNTU:

* [Guide to install the Matlab kernel](https://anneurai.net/2015/11/12/matlab-based-ipython-notebooks/)
* [Guide to install Matlab magics for use in Jupyter Notebooks](https://arokem.github.io/python-matlab-bridge/)
* Additionally, you may need to create a [simlink/adjust your .bash_profile] (http://superuser.com/questions/381825/running-matlab-from-mac-osx-terminal) accordingly.
* [Installing Matlab Engine API for Python](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab-engine-for-python.html)

## Microeconomic Theory for the Models and Methods of Quantitative Economics master's program (UAB and Paris Sorbonne)

A Jupyter Notebook describing the solution of a social planner's problem of a CD utlity function using SymPy.
