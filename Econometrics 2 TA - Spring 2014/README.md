# Problem Sets Solutions and Codes

### Problem Set 1

The PDF solution and the matlab codes associated with the problem set are included, with generalized routines for calculating the HAC corrected variances (implementation of Newey-West). Includes an introduction to time-series analysis and the consequences of a misspecified model that violates weak exogeneity, as well as some Monte-Carlo exercises to study the asymptotic behaviour of various estimators.

### Problem Set 2

Likewise, a PDF solutions is included expanding on the GMM estimation technique and its properties. It also explores how other estimators (such as IV, Maximum Likelihood) can be re-cast as a GMM estimation when proper orthgonality conditions can be used as moments. Further, the consequences of spurious regressions is studied from a time-series perspective.
