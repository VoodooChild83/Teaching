# Description of Files

### Time Series Analysis Matlab Functions

In this folder students will find some generalized functions for time series analysis. 

### Solutions to Part 2 of Econometrics Course in the Barcelona GSE's MPFMP Master's Program 

This file contains Jupyter Notebooks detailing the solutions to programming homework assignments using the Matlab Kernel in the Jupyter environment. The .m files are also included for those without the Matlab kernel installed in their Jupyter environment.

### Practice

#### Monte-Carlo Exercise of OLS properties

In this module the student can explore the different properties of OLS with finite and asymptotic sample sizes; and exploration of the role of omited variable bias and correlated regressors; and the problem of endogeneity of the regressor and the 2-Stage Least Squares solution to this problem. 

#### Effects of colinear/correlated regressors on inference testing

Since it is very unlikely that random variables would achieve "perfect" collinearity outside of an introduced collinearity by the econometrician, the exercise focuses on exploring how varying degrees of correlation between regressors affects inference testing. The t-test statistic and F-test statistic are studied under these conditions to elucidate their behavior.
